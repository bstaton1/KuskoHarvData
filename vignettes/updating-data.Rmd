## _Before You Begin: `r fa("git-alt")` Git and `r fa("github")` GitHub_

:::{.indent}

Updating the data sets in 'KuskoHarvData' requires basic operating knowledge of Git and GitHub (remote vs. local repositories, forking, pulling/pushing, committing, branching, and pull requests), and you are advised to use [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) to interact with local and remote repositories.
**If this makes you uncomfortable or if you have _any_ questions, please contact the package developer (<bstaton.qes@gmail.com>) and he will assist as he is able.**

If you are unfamiliar with these topics but wish to proceed, you can learn about them by reading the articles on each topic linked below; ignore any content regarding the command line or GitHub CLI -- these topics are unnecessary for our purposes.

* [`r fa("git-alt")` Git overview](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)
* [`r fa("github")` GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
* [`r fa("code-fork")` Forking workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project?tool=desktop)
* [`r fa("code-commit")` Commits from GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop#selecting-changes-to-include-in-a-commit)
* [`r fa("arrow-up-from-bracket")` Pushing changes from GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github-from-github-desktop)
* [`r fa("code-pull-request")` Submitting a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project?tool=desktop#making-a-pull-request)

Specific instructions about how to perform the necessary GitHub tasks will not be described here, so please familiarize yourself before beginning.
These instructions also assume you have installed [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (accept all defaults when prompted), and that you have installed the current version of 'KuskoHarvEst':

```R
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst")
```

:::

```{r make-header-fn, echo = FALSE}
# create a global section counter
counter <<- -1

# function to create the html tags to build the sectoin header
make_header = function(text, icon) {
  counter <<- counter + 1
  '<font size="+3">NUM</font> ICON _TEXT_' |> 
    stringr::str_replace("NUM", as.character(counter)) |> 
    stringr::str_replace("ICON", as.character(fa(icon))) |> 
    stringr::str_replace("TEXT", text)
}
```

## `r make_header("Fork & Clone (One Time Only)", "code-fork")`

:::{.indent}

**Complete this step only if you have not already done so in a previous year.**

This R package is contained in the GitHub repository: [bstaton1/KuskoHarvData](https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvData).

Ensure you have a GitHub account, and fork the repository to your account.
Clone your remote forked repository to a local repository.
You will make changes to the local repository, then push them up to your remote repository.
After you are done with changes, you will submit a pull request to have them reviewed before they are merged in with the centralized repository.

:::

## `r make_header("Sync/Fetch/Pull", "download")`

:::{.indent}

**This step is essential to make sure your repository is current with the centralized version.**

First, make sure your remote forked repository is up-to-date with the centralized repository by [syncing your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-web-ui).
Then, from GitHub Desktop, fetch and pull any changes to your local repository.
This should not occur, but if you have any errors about [merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts), they will need to be addressed before proceeding.

:::

## `r make_header("Create a New Branch", "code-branch")`

:::{.indent}

**Do not ever** make changes directly to the `main` (or `master`) branch -- instead, create a new branch in your local repository before proceeding.
This will ensure that any changes you make will not interfere (_just in case_) with the current working version until they have been reviewed.
Name the branch something like `add-20YY-data`.
All changes you make from here forward should be on this branch.

:::

## `r make_header("Organize/Add Opener Data Files", "folder-open")`

:::{.indent}

**Only add data from openers in which drift gillnets were allowed.**
It is okay to retain the set net data for these openers, but **do not add data from set net only openers.**

Each opener should have at least these data files:

* `BBH_20YY_0M_DD.csv`: completed trip interview data from the Bethel Boat Harbor
* `CBM_20YY_0M_DD.csv`: completed trip interview data from the Community Based Harvest Monitoring Program
* `Flight_counts_20YY_08_12.csv`: flight data

Where the `YY`, `M`, and `DD` are replaced with the appropriate year, month, and day, respectively.
The file `FC_20YY_0M_DD.csv` (ONC fish camp surveys) may also be available, include it as well if so.
Please see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/04-docs/01-raw-data.html) for the proper formatting of these files, but if they worked properly to produce estimates in-season using 'KuskoHarvEst', then they will work properly here.

Within the `data-raw` subfolder of your local 'KuskoHarvData' repo, create a new subfolder for each driftnet opener with data you plan to add.
Follow the example given by previous openers **exactly** (i.e., one subfolder per opener, named `20YY_0M_DD` with the appropriate date information) and place the data files for each opener in each subfolder.

:::

## `r make_header("Add Opener Metadata", "table")`

:::{.indent}

Within the `data-raw` subfolder, you will find a file called `opener-metadata.csv` -- open it in a spreadsheet editor.

Add a new row for each drift opener following the examples from previous openers **exactly** (i.e., date/time formatting is essential).
Ideally the USFWS or ADF&G announcement that authorized the opener would be added, but if this is not available, please enter `NA` for this column.

:::

## `r make_header("Update Bethel Test Fishery Data", "table")`

:::{.indent}

Navigate to the [ADF&G Bethel Test Fishery webpage](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareakuskokwim.btf), click "Daily CPUE All Species", scroll to the bottom, click **Export** > **Data** > **CSV Format**.
Place the downloaded file (will be named `PUB_Bethel Test Fish - Daily CPUE.csv`) in the `data-raw` subdirectory of your local repo.

Because of the timeline of Bethel Test Fishery operations, **do not complete this step or proceed until after August 31 in the current year.**

:::

## `r make_header("Compile Exported Data Objects", "sync")`

:::{.indent}

From within your local repository, open the R project file (`KuskoHarvData.Rproj`) in RStudio.
Then execute the following command:

```R
source("data-raw/execute-prep-scripts.R")
```

This step will take some time (could be a half hour or more).
While the code runs, progress messages will be printed to the console -- **if you see any errors, you must stop and resolve them.**
Please do not hesitate to contact the package developer (<bstaton.qes@gmail.com>) if needed.

:::

## `r make_header("Increment Package Version", "plus")`

:::{.indent}

From within your local repository, open the file named `DESCRIPTION` in RStudio Desktop, and change this field to reflect the year you just added:

```
Version: 20YY.0
```

For example, if the current version is `2023.1` this means data are current through 2023, and the package been patched 1 time (updated once after adding 2023 data to data through 2022).
After adding the 2024 data, the version should be updated to `2024.0`.

:::

## `r make_header("Commit Changes", "code-commit")`

:::{.indent}

Open GitHub Desktop and commit the changes you've made as follows (except swap `YY`, `M`, and `DD` for the appropriate date information):

1. Commit all changes to all opener data files (`data-raw/20YY_0M_DD/*.csv`).

    <u>Commit message</u>: `Add 20YY harvest monitoring data`
2. Commit all changes to the opener meta data file (`data-raw/opener-metadata.csv`).

    <u>Commit message</u>: `Add 20YY opener meta data`
3. Commit all changes to the Bethel Test Fishery data file (`data-raw/PUB_Bethel Test Fish - Daily CPUE.csv`).

    <u>Commit message</u>: `Add 20YY BTF data`
4. Commit all changes to all files with the extension `.rda` (found in the `data` subfolder).

    <u>Commit message</u>:  `Update exported data objects`
5. Commit all changes to the `DESCRIPTION` file.

    <u>Commit message</u>: `Update package version (now 20YY.0)`

There should be no remaining changes to commit now.

:::

## `r make_header("Submit Pull Request", "code-pull-request")`

:::{.indent}

You are now ready to push your branch to your forked remote repository and submit a pull request.

Name your pull request something like "Add 20YY Data" and ensure you are requesting to **merge into `bstaton1/KuskoHarvData` from `YourUserName/KuskoHarvData`.**

In the description, please note any quirks with the process or issues with the data that are of note.
When you are done, submit the request -- this will notify the package developer that your changes are ready for review.
